Council in high school, the Vice President to be specific. There was an elected member that was not performing his job very well and it was reflecting badly on the rest of council. The executive council met and discussed the idea of impeaching him. All of the members were very harsh about his performance and about his character. I agreed that he was not doing his job well but I considered his age and that he was inexperienced and just needed some guidance. Still the others decided to put him up for impeachment. When the idea was presented at the next council meeting he was upset by this news and I felt bad for him and I felt awful standing next to the people telling him that. The next week he presented a speech to try and persuade people to vote for him to stay. He was not very popular at school and in council so it was not helpful. I still had not decided which way I would vote but hearing everyone say bad things about him behind his back made me feel terrible. I knew he had done a terrible job but I felt he could be helped. I still voted for him to be impeached, and hoped he would still come back. He was impeached and never returned to council again. I loved is passion for council and after that vote it was lost. It's only in retrospective that I realize how much power was given to myself and the other members, and at the same time how little. We are powerless to the mob mentality and now I wonder if the much power should be given to people that age.",1,1,1,1,2,2,2,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,2,3,4,1,0,NA,1,2,Criminology and Criminal Justice,0,3,1,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,1,4,3,5,1,1,1,5,5,2,1,4,1,1,6,5,3,3,5,2,69.8,6,2,7,6,4,1,5,Winter 2014,78,3,3,7,1,A,9/25/14,KS,24.2,II-SR,10,7,B,Friday,5,Yes,Leaned on wall,9/5/14,12/8/14,94,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,200,4200,12000,NA,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.5,NA,Plastic,143.0000007,9,30,10,14,11,12,13,15,NA,29,NA,NA,36,35,6,5,NA,21,22,23,20,8,34,NA,25,24,NA,26,28,32,37,33,27,0,31,19,16,18,17,2,NA,NA,NA,4,3,1,7,9/26/14 15:30,9/26/14,15:30,9,26,14,31,57,9/25/14,9,25,14,31,56,9/5/14,9,5,14,31,36,0.223404255,0.212765957,Pass,6.5,6,1,3.5,4,2.933333333,5.5,3.833333333,5,5,5,2.25,HighPower,5,NA,Credentials,Female,WorstGrade,1,1,1,1,1,5,+,AgenticFemale,Agentic,FemaleTarget,4.6,0.650793651,1,0CarletonUniversity,22,704,7451128,18,party,NA,NA,caleo,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,1,7,2,7,5,7,1,5,2,"3, 6, 9",9,2,6,5,6,White & East Indian,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,3,4,3,2,3,4,4,1,4,NA,2,15,Journalism,1,-1,1,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,4,3,2,3,4,4,3,2,17,4,3,2,1,4,2,18,5,3,3,4,3,3,68,4,2,7,6,5,1,9,Winter 2014,92,7,3,3,1,A,9/29/14,ZvA,21.9,II-SR,20,6,B,Friday,3,Yes,Leaned on wall,9/5/14,12/8/14,94,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,200,4200,12000,NA,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.5,NA,Plastic,196.999992,6,31,7,8,9,10,12,11,NA,34,NA,NA,36,35,17,16,NA,19,20,21,18,26,28,NA,14,13,NA,15,32,27,37,29,33,0,30,25,22,24,23,NA,2,NA,NA,4,3,1,5,9/29/14 10:34,9/29/14,10:34,9,29,14,31,60,9/29/14,9,29,14,31,60,9/5/14,9,5,14,31,36,0.255319149,0.255319149,Pass,6.5,7,3,7,2.5,3,4.5,3.5,4,3,3,2.75,NA,5,NA,Credentials,Female,WorstGrade,1,0,0,0,1,2,-,AgenticMale,Agentic,MaleTarget,5.6,0.317460317,1,0CarletonUniversity,23,736,7452756,18,pyrat,aflat,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,341,348,345,342,339,336,333,Winter 2014,A,1,4,1,6,4,6,3,7,2,7,1,5,3,"3, 9, 0, 6",8,7,7,7,8,1,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,4,3,4,2,3,2,2,2,2,5,"During that situation, I felt helpless and it made me feel really stressed because I really wanted to pass",1,1,"Biology, minor in chemistry",0,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,4,3,1,3,4,3,2,2,3,4,5,2,1,1,1,3,4,6,4,3,3,3,69.8,6,3,7,7,7,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,A,9/29/14,CC,20.4,SR-II,10,6,A,Friday,5,N/A,"Leaned on wall; Asked for helped during Stroop task and informed her to use the number line instead of square number key pad; Asked for help for SR meeting response, directed participant to sentence.",9/5/14,12/8/14,94,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,200,4200,12000,NA,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.5,NA,Plastic,66.00000097,16,30,6,11,9,8,10,7,2,33,NA,NA,36,35,26,25,NA,13,14,15,NA,24,31,12,18,17,NA,19,32,34,37,29,27,0,28,23,20,22,21,3,NA,NA,NA,5,4,1,NA,9/29/14 19:05,9/29/14,19:05,9,29,14,31,60,9/29/14,9,29,14,31,60,9/5/14,9,5,14,31,36,0.255319149,0.255319149,Pass,6,6.5,6,5.5,3,2.933333333,4,3.666666667,4,5,6,3.25,LowPower,4,NA,Credentials,Female,BestGrade,0,1,0,1,1,3,+,AgenticFemale,Agentic,FemaleTarget,7.4,0.484126984,1,0CarletonUniversity,25,913,7470237,18,party,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,336,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,5,5,2,5,2,4,3,5,4,"3,9,6,9,6,3,3,9",7,4,5,6,6,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,I was instructing my coach's son in horseback riding and was in a position of power because of being able to tell him what to do in order to improve his riding abilities.

It felt good being the leader but it was also stressful because if there was a mistake, I would be the one to blame.",1,1,1,1,4,1,1,3,4,3,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,16,NA,1,7,English BA,0,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,4,3,2,3,2,20,5,4,2,6,6,1,9,5,5,3,3,2,4,68,6,2,6,7,5,1,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,A,11/11/14,CC,21,II-SR,10,6,B,Friday,5,Yes,Sat down,9/5/14,12/8/14,94,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,200,4200,12000,NA,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.5,NA,Plastic,240.000002,3,33,17,18,20,19,22,21,2,29,NA,NA,36,35,11,NA,10,13,14,15,12,16,28,NA,5,NA,4,6,31,32,37,27,30,0,34,26,23,25,24,NA,7,NA,NA,9,8,1,NA,11/11/14 16:44,11/11/14,16:44,11,11,14,92,103,11/11/14,11,11,14,92,103,9/5/14,9,5,14,31,36,0.712765957,0.712765957,Fail,6.5,3.5,6.5,5.5,4,3.266666667,6,2.833333333,5,4,5,3.5,HighPower,NA,4,NoCredentials,Female,BestGrade,0,1,0,1,1,3,+,AgenticMale,Agentic,MaleTarget,7,-0.349206349,-1,1CarletonUniversity,34,2057,7578247,19,party,fatal,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,Fall 2014,89%,6,1,1,5,3,5,5,6,3,7,6,2,2,39696339,5,4,6,5,5,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,This summer I was a nanny.

One of my main tasks was to create performance reports for senior leadership. As such, I was given much responsibility since I was able to report on how team members were performing. Since much of their salary is based on production bonuses, I was a key part in ensuring accurate and fair wages for the time I was there. Often, team members would email me asking how and why they were at the production level they were at, and I had to explain to them how bonuses were calculated and how I obtained the production level that I did. Sometimes, people were unsatisfied with this and felt they should have been receiving more bonus, at which time I was required to prove that the calculations were correct.",1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,8,NA,2,20,actuarial science/economics double major,0,2,2,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,4,1,1,5,5,2,2,NA,3,3,2,2,1,2,20,2,5,3,4,4,3,70,5,3,7,7,5,2,12,Spring 2014,3.5 (85%),4,5,7,4,2,9/12/14,C.K.,70,II-SR,20,6,B,Friday,4,Yes,N/A,9/8/14,12/5/14,88,1,1,1,0,0,0,7,0.25,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,NA,104,2988,17500,NA,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.15,"Online studies are not offered until 10/13/14, so students who participate early (i.e., from 09/08/14 until 10/12/14) must do in person studies.",Plastic,139.0000004,16,32,2,6,7,4,3,5,NA,28,NA,NA,36,35,12,NA,11,19,20,21,18,26,27,NA,14,NA,13,15,33,29,37,30,34,0,31,25,22,24,23,8,NA,NA,NA,10,9,1,17,9/12/14 16:59,9/12/14,16:59,9,12,14,31,43,9/12/14,9,12,14,31,43,9/8/14,9,8,14,31,39,0.045454545,0.045454545,Fail,7,7,4,4,3,3.333333333,7,4.666666667,3,3,5,2.5,HighPower,NA,5,NoCredentials,Female,WorstGrade,1,0,0,0,0,1,-,AgenticFemale,Agentic,FemaleTarget,4.8,1.484126984,-1,0MichiganStateUniversity,59,2821,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,9/12/14,C.K.,70,SR-II,10,6,C,Monday,4,N/A,Participant sat on the couch for the written portion of the study and also took a while to finish the written portion of the study.

Knowing that in order to get what you desire, you must prove yourself to someone else over other participants, gives me a drive different than anything else.",1,3,Earth Sciences,0,3,2,0,1,2,2,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,2,2,4,3,4,2,2,2,5,1,1,4,2,3,3,6,3,4,4,4,70,4,3,7,7,4,1,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,11/6/14,Mari,74,SR-II,20,6,A,Friday,5,Yes,"particpant tried to leave after he met me at the door, had to call him back.",9/8/14,12/5/14,88,1,1,1,0,0,0,5,1,1,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,62,600,3000,600,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,Plastic,103.0000065,21,27,15,18,20,17,16,19,26,31,NA,NA,36,35,7,NA,6,12,13,14,NA,2,32,11,4,3,NA,5,28,30,37,29,34,0,33,25,22,24,23,NA,NA,8,NA,10,9,1,NA,11/6/14 13:59,11/6/14,13:59,11,6,14,92,98,11/6/14,11,6,14,92,98,9/8/14,9,8,14,31,39,0.670454545,0.670454545,Pass,6,6,5,5.5,2,2.866666667,5.5,3.166666667,2,5,6,2.75,LowPower,5,NA,Credentials,Male,BestGrade,1,1,0,0,1,3,+,CommunalFemale,Communal,FemaleTarget,6.6,-0.015873016,-1,0MontanaStateUniversity,117,1667,7543480,22,party,NA,noice,caelo,3,NA,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,Spring 2014,A,8,2,1,7,1,7,4,6,2,7,1,7,2,"3,9,6,9,6,3,3,9",8,1,1,6,4,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,4,3,4,2,4,3,1,4,4,4,1,5,"Every time I take an exam I feel like the professor has power over me.

I realized that the best that I could do is try to relax, but I felt that such a huge part of my life was in someone else's hands. It was frustrating that I worked so hard to do my part in academics, but I could lose all of that just in case my interviewer didn't like me for some particular reason that could be out of my control. I felt helpless because I could not actively do anything do get into medical school besides try my best, but there was no definite way to have a positive interaction with this person.",1,5,biology,1,-1,1,0,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,2,1,1,4,4,2,2,4,5,2,1,7,4,4,1,1,1,2,15,5,5,5,3,3,5,72,3,3,7,6,4,1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,a,11/19/14,Valeria,78,SR-II,10,6,b,Monday,4,Yes,NA,8/25/14,12/5/14,102,1,1,1,1,0,0,5,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,20,360,480,80,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.1,"In case you need some history regarding our pool: As of Fall 2013, students in Intro.

On the second day, us coaches were asked to demonstrate volleyball drills, so that the campers could see how they were supposed to be ran.

Everyday I was in a role of power because I was looking after children and their well-being. I had to make certain judgment calls, and I had the power to tell a child what to do (if they didn't clean up after snack time or something to that effect). I had the power to write them up if they were being disrespectful, or to even talk to their parents at the end of the day. It wasn't so much that it was empowering but more of a rewarding job that carried prestige. The only reason it would be a powerful position is because you have not just one, but many lives in your hands, and that is how you have to think of it. You alone may see something another counselor couldn't which is why it is so important to really look after each child. Ultimately, we called the shots and controlled the outcome of many situations that could have possibly been bad. For example, the Y took a trip to the Eagles stadium. It is so huge an adult could probably have trouble if they got lost. We had to make sure that they stayed together at all times and nobody trailed off. It was hard and stressful, but when you're in that position, you remember your in charge, and if a child isn't listening to you, you always have a choice of what should be done. You take charge of a situation without being mean and they will respect you.  Sometimes, you even change lives  and that kid looks forward to seeing you everyday and next summer. It was a much more rewarding job than stressful.",1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,2,2,NA,1,3,Administration of Justice,0,3,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,1,3,3,3,1,3,2,2,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,6,7,1,5,5,1,65,5,2,4,7,1,1,3,2014,C,6,4,3,3,E1,9/16/14,JMM,70,II-SR,10,7,A,Friday,3,Yes,NA,8/24/14,12/1/14,99,1,1,0,1,0,0,3,0.5,1,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,10,350,850,50,1,0,0,3,1,1,0.1,NA,Plastic,66.99999492,18,33,2,6,5,3,7,4,NA,31,NA,NA,36,35,17,NA,16,9,10,11,8,12,27,NA,14,NA,13,15,28,32,37,29,30,0,34,25,22,24,23,NA,NA,NA,19,21,20,1,26,9/16/14 16:55,9/16/14,16:55,9,16,14,31,47,9/16/14,9,16,14,31,47,8/24/14,8,24,14,0,24,0.232323232,0.232323232,Pass,4,7,4.5,2.5,1.5,2.8,4,2.333333333,3,3,7,1,HighPower,NA,5,NoCredentials,Female,WorstGrade,0,1,0,1,1,3,+,CommunalMale,Communal,MaleTarget,5.8,-0.849206349,-1,0PennStateAbington,5,182,7392215,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,331,354,351,349,346,343,340,337,334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,3,5,3; 9; 0; 6; 9; 6; 3; 3; 9,6,7,6,5,7,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,1,20,"When I was younger it was like me and my old best friend were always in competition.

I have to think of ways to teach children about the abstract teachings of their faith, but they are restless! However, they are very intelligent and preppy, for Sunday mornings. Usually, lessons are set up where desks are arranged in circles, and in this intimate setting, children usually talk with each other and sometimes know each other. I am in power, or in authority, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the attention of children to the point where they are entirely quiet. Despite this, however, I am able to communicate to the children that they need to turn to a certain page, to read along in a book, and I am able to ask them to respond to a question or to read. In which case, if this goes smoothly, I feel that I can move the lesson along, especially when lesson plans have less rigid structure. At the end of the time, I observe my colleague ask the children (as an entire class again) what they learned in that session; this is a process of evaluation of their new-found knowledge, and of our teaching methodology. When the kids leave (we have to tell them to wait for their parents, first, and enforce this rule), my colleague and I discuss methods to improve teaching, and to therefore exert more meaningful authority over the students in such a way that future lessons can be taught smoothly and in an enjoyable manner for student and teacher.",1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,0,NA,NA,1,"Music, Psychology (Mathematics emphasis)",1,2,1,0,1,2,1,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,3,4,3,3,4,NA,3,5,4,2,3,2,NA,2,2,6,1,5,4,3,73,4,4,7,7,5,NA,0,Spring 2013,C,5,4,5,2,1,10/16/14,NB,72,SR-II,10,5,B,Friday,5,Yes,NA,10/2/14,12/12/14,71,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,3,31,2000,12000,700,0,1,0,1,1,1,0.23,NA,Metal,91.99999887,8,34,2,7,3,6,4,5,NA,33,NA,NA,36,35,14,13,NA,19,20,21,18,23,29,NA,25,24,NA,26,31,32,37,30,27,0,28,12,9,11,10,NA,NA,15,NA,17,16,1,22,10/16/14 16:18,10/16/14,16:18,10,16,14,61,77,10/16/14,10,16,14,61,77,10/2/14,10,2,14,61,63,0.197183099,0.197183099,Fail,4.5,4.5,4,5,1.5,2.533333333,6,2.833333333,5,4,6,1.75,HighPower,4,NA,Credentials,Male,WorstGrade,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CommunalFemale,Communal,FemaleTarget,5.6,-0.349206349,1,0UCDavis,4,2561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,10/6/14,KG,77,SR-II,20,7,B,Friday,4,No (3/4 incorrect),Person set clipboard down on top of items on the table while filling out surveys,10/2/14,12/12/14,71,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,3,31,2000,12000,700,0,1,0,1,1,1,0.23,NA,Metal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/6/14,10,6,14,61,67,10/2/14,10,2,14,61,63,NA,0.056338028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1UCDavis,40,1155,7490793,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the directions,357,327,354,351,346,343,340,337,334,331,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,6,6,3 9 6 9 6 3 3 9,5,9,5,5,5,4,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,20,Over the break I stayed with my parents.

I was new to the area and often felt as though I was being judged by everyone. This was especially true when it came time to go to recess. One individual in particular was especially heinous towards me; in essence, he was the first ""real"" bully I had ever met. Any time I would try to play on the basket ball court he would be there to either push me away from it or make some kind of commotion out of what seemed like a trivial confrontation. Initially, I did feel powerless because my elementary school joy seemed to be determined by a child who was simply bigger than me and because it seemed I couldn't even turn to adults. Instead, rather than seek help from teachers or staff, I simply asked the bully for his reasons for bullying. After receiving no real answer, I decided that self-defense was the only real means to end this feud. The boy confronted me on another occasion, and rather than run away or get punched around, this time, I decided to actually try and defend myself.  I ended up punching the kid in the face and had to go the principal's office to explain my case. Even though it was clearly self-defense, I was still punished. Not only did I feel powerless to the bully, but also felt cheated by the school's staff, and once again thought I couldn't really rely on anyone to help when I felt helpless.",2,11,Economics,0,0,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,1,1,1,4,4,4,2,3,4,4,2,2,15,3,3,1,1,2,2,20,3,4,3,3,3,3,65,6,3,7,4,4,2,20,Spring 2014,C-,3,3,10,2,1,10/21/14,KG,72,SR-II,20,5,C,Friday,5,N/A,NA,10/2/14,12/12/14,71,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,3,31,2000,12000,700,0,1,0,1,1,1,0.23,NA,Metal,234.999999,15,34,16,19,20,18,17,21,NA,27,NA,NA,36,35,9,NA,8,24,25,26,NA,22,29,23,3,NA,2,4,32,28,37,33,31,0,30,14,11,13,12,5,NA,NA,NA,7,6,1,10,10/21/14 17:00,10/21/14,17:00,10,21,14,61,82,10/21/14,10,21,14,61,82,10/2/14,10,2,14,61,63,0.267605634,0.267605634,Pass,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,2.933333333,4,3.833333333,3,3,4,3,LowPower,NA,1,NoCredentials,Male,WorstGrade,1,0,0,0,0,1,-,AgenticFemale,Agentic,FemaleTarget,4,0.650793651,-1,0UCDavis,49,1274,7502705,20,party,a flat,coin nice,cola,NA,NA,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,2,6,3,6,3,7,6,5,5,3 9 6 9 6 3 3 9,3,3,3,3,3,2,This Stroop task has no feedback,2,"I was in a position of power when I worked as a intern in a school district.

In this position, I conducted practices, with the consent of the coach, to my own discretion in preparation for the next game. Though the thought of having the responsibility to lead the team was intimidating, I overcame my nerves and lead the team in a manner that I felt fit best. I felt that my duty was to encourage my teammates, as well as to establish discipline when the coach was talking. I usually was picked to go first in drills or used as the example; since I had more experience than most other players on the team and because I was captain for two years, I was confident and did not fear the attention. As captain, another duty was to be the ""middle-man"" between the coach and the players; so I was, essentially, representing the players and the coach and reporting to one about the other.

That opinion is shared by my current World Politics teacher of UC Riverside as well. I can honestly say that the only times I feel like I did not have the power to change something or get what I want, is when it comes down to the usage of money. I usually have power over my feelings, situations and life overall. But money is different. I went to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills this weekend with two of my friends who are really wealthy. I am well off but not well off like them. I was only going for the ride, not really expecting to spend much. I did not want to burden my parents.

I refused to give her the money and then called my supervisor up to handle the situation. I knew right away that I had given the money to her and that she was trying to deceive me because from the moment she walked in, i knew that she would not be a quiet customer. She walked in and shouted a question to me, which annoyed me because it was rude to shout and because i was with another customer. She then took one of the sample spray bottles and sprayed it all over herself, and then carried it with her across the store. I distrusted how she looked and acted and was sure that she was going to steal it. When she lied to me about the money, i was almost willing to give in but i was not going to be blamed for being ten dollars short in my drawer.

I wanted to participate in a program, similar to an internship for said the career. She told me that when I would get older, that I'd get over that passion because it required a great amount of intelligence. She relayed her opinions to my mother who then decided that she didn't want me to attend the summer program because it wasn't profitable in her eyes, and thought I'd be better off getting a summer job in retail. Not having my mother's consent at 14 made me feel very unhappy to say the least because everyone believed I couldn't grow up to accomplish more than my siblings had.

Mr. Beerman, his actual name, assigned a simple group project. I'm pretty sure I did the exact same project in elementary school. We were supposed to create a maze using quotes from the books we had read over the year. I had been a student of Beerman's previously, so it seemed artsy and straightforward, which we were used to at that point. I was gathered into a group and we made plans to complete the actual maze. Those plans fell through and we rescheduled due to cancellations from pretty much everyone. They had excuses, believable, so I changed the date and time. Then one group member flaked, the other ordered food and ate the entire night while the last member slept on my couch. I finished the project by myself the night before it was due. It looked like I finished it within the five minutes before it was due. I could have told Beerman they did not contribute, it would have been true and he would have believed me. But their grades hung in the balance, in Beerman's class it could have been the difference between an F and a D or a D and a C.

At the end of it all I got a compliment from my boss saying ""Good Job"" which never happens and from his assistant saying that I was a good job and that he would not have been able to handle it himself.",2,20,Wildlife conservation and management,0,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,3,2,2,20,4,4,1,1,5,1,5,5,7,1,5,4,1,76,4,4,7,7,7,2,20,Fall 2014,C,1,4,3,3,4,12/2/14,DM,74,SR-II,20,6,C,Thursday,5,N/A,NA,8/27/14,12/12/14,107,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,26,600,2500,140,1,0,0,1,1,1,0.33,NA,Plastic,209.0000017,26,29,19,20,21,23,24,22,NA,27,NA,NA,36,35,8,7,NA,16,17,18,NA,25,33,15,10,NA,9,11,32,28,37,30,34,0,31,6,3,5,4,12,NA,NA,NA,14,13,1,2,12/2/14 12:54,12/2/14,12:54,12,2,14,122,124,12/2/14,12,2,14,122,124,8/27/14,8,27,14,0,27,0.906542056,0.906542056,Pass,4,6.5,6.5,4,2,3.466666667,6,3,4,4,7,1.25,LowPower,NA,5,NoCredentials,Female,WorstGrade,0,0,0,1,0,1,-,AgenticFemale,Agentic,FemaleTarget,5.4,-0.182539683,1,0UniversityOfFlorida,121,2592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,12/2/14,DM,74,II-SR,10,6,A,Monday,5,No(2),"Error during the experiment, and the participant was unable to finish",8/27/14,12/12/14,107,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,0.5,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,26,600,2500,140,1,0,0,1,1,1,0.33,NA,Plastic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/2/14,12,2,14,122,124,8/27/14,8,27,14,0,27,NA,0.906542056,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0UniversityOfFlorida,122,2216,7603664,18,party,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,Fall 2014,A,5,1,1,5,3,6,3,5,5,5,2,6,2,"3,9,6",6,3,2,5,3,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,3,3,3,2,4,3,1,3,2,4,1,3,I was interviewing for a job here at UF.

I must admit sometime I got lazy and worked less  than most of my assistants and it is frustrating to think that I could've done more, but in my defense, I was meant only to organize and teach people what to do. I remember a particular moment when we lost a huge collection of books (The dual enrollment books where placed in a different school since they are really valuable) for Dual Enrollment and my principal was fuming mad at the assistant who lost the collection. I took the blame and made sure that the assistant was let go of the charges. I had to pay for some of the books, but managed to find most of them afterwards with the help of my assistants at the time.

By me being young and cool with just about everyone who I worked with, they felt as though I did not really have a say so as to whether they should do their job just as well as they would if my manager was around. Several of my coworkers felt they did not have to follow any of the usual set rules, and that I would not tell because we were friends and close in age. They felt they could just half do the job, and it would not be an issue until I started telling them what rules were set for them. They did not think I was serious- some even laughed. I immediately called my manager and told her exactly who was not following the guidelines. She was amazed to see me call because she thought I could not handle myself, but she then fully gained my trust.

I was more concerned about how I would get them to have a meaningful discussion on the topic than anything else. I was afraid I would not say knowledgeable or wise things. I was less afraid of them acting out or misbehaving. I guess I just felt that the simple answer would be to direct their conversation back to the topic at hand. If they did start messing around with each other and moving around I knew that I'd have to stop them. I knew that I couldn't let them goof off and I wasn't about to let them.,1,1,1,1,3,2,2,4,2,1,2,3,4,4,4,2,4,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,30,pre-nursing,0,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2,4,3,1,5,3,3,3,6,6,1,5,2,3,4,3,2,3,70,3,4,7,6,4,2,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8/20/14,12/4/14,106,1,1,1,0,0,0,NA,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,4,40,900,6200,500,1,0,0,2,1,1,0.66,NA,Plastic,205.0000008,25,27,9,10,11,12,13,14,24,33,NA,NA,36,35,20,19,NA,16,17,18,15,26,34,NA,22,NA,21,23,30,31,NA,29,32,0,28,8,5,7,6,NA,NA,NA,2,4,3,1,NA,10/14/14 14:24,10/14/14,14:24,10,14,14,61,75,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8/20/14,8,20,14,0,20,0.518867925,NA,Pass,5.5,4,1.5,4.5,5.5,3.133333333,6,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,HighPower,NA,5,NoCredentials,Female,BestGrade,NA,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,CommunalMale,Communal,MaleTarget,8.2,-0.682539683,1,NAUniversityOfToronto,10,613,7438101,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,Winter 2014,96,7,5,1,3,2,7,5,7,7,7,2,6,6,"3,9,6,9,6,3,3,9",6,9,7,6,9,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,NA,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,3,4,2,3,4,4,3,2,2,3,4,4,2,10,"A situation when someone had power over me was during the time that I was being examined for my NLS (National Lifeguard Society) qualifications.

It would be a Crossfit-style drill where all the wrestlers had to perform exercises for 5 minutes straight with 30 seconds of rest for an hour. Some of these exercises included going on the rowing machines, doing pull-ups, skipping with a 10-lb jumping rope, doing push-ups, climbing up and down 3 flights of stairs, and biking, all at high-intensity for 5 minutes each without stopping until our 30 second break, at which point the drill would continue. When I first did these workouts, it was extremely hard for me because I was not used to these high-intensity workouts. I often failed the expectations of my coach. For example, when my all my energy was spent and I could not continue with the pull-ups, he would come to me and start yelling at me to continue just like everyone else. He would be at my face until I got up on the pull-up bar and creaked one up, at which point he would go away to yell at someone else. He told me that even though I thought I wouldn't be able to complete the exercise, he said he would not let me stop. Even when I didn't stop but slowed my pace a little, he would come back and tell me to give my max effort. Sometimes all I wanted to do was drink water during the 5 minutes and he would stop me from doing and demand that I continue the exercise until the break. Initially I felt miserable and wanted to quit because all I wanted to do was be on the mat and wrestle, not do Crossfit, because wrestling was at least fun whereas depleting myself of energy wasn't.  But in some ways, him always being around and knowing that he was watching me really forced me to work hard and in the end it actually got me to a point where I adapted myself to enjoy his encouragements because it made me stronger and a better wrestler.

I felt annoyed that I had to go through this effort just to go to the mall, and I feel like I was fake to her because I was nice to her not because I like her or just to be nice, but because i needed something, and I did not like fooling her in this way.",2,4,Neuroscience,1,2,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,1,1,2,3,2,2,3,4,4,2,2,1,6,3,5,1,1,5,2,4,5,5,2,4,3,3,80.6,3,4,7,5,3,2,3,Winter 2014,90,8,2,2,2,94,11/19/14,VE,23.2,SR-II,10,6,C,Monday,5,N/A,Leaned one shoulder against wall during clipboard task,9/22/14,12/2/14,71,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,NA,1300,5000,30,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,Plastic,194.0000026,12,33,2,6,5,4,7,3,NA,34,NA,NA,36,35,23,NA,22,14,15,16,NA,17,32,13,20,NA,19,21,30,29,37,31,27,0,28,11,8,10,9,NA,NA,24,NA,26,25,1,18,11/19/14 11:42,11/19/14,11:42,11,19,14,92,111,11/19/14,11,19,14,92,111,9/22/14,9,22,14,31,53,0.816901408,0.816901408,Pass,3.5,6,2,3,5.5,2.533333333,5.5,2.833333333,3,5,5,2.5,LowPower,NA,2,NoCredentials,Female,WorstGrade,0,0,1,0,0,1,-,CommunalFemale,Communal,FemaleTarget,4.4,-0.349206349,-1,0UniversityOfToronto,48,2862,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96,11/19/14,VE,23.5,SR-II,20,5,C,Friday,5,N/A,NA,9/22/14,12/2/14,71,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,NA,1300,5000,30,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,Plastic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11/19/14,11,19,14,92,111,9/22/14,9,22,14,31,53,NA,0.816901408,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0UniversityOfToronto,49,1975,7570679,18,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,357,330,354,351,NA,345,342,339,336,333,Summer 2014,A,3,1,5,5,4,5,3,5,4,5,5,5,5,"3, 9, 6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,This Stroop task has no feedback,2,normal,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,100,NA,1,1,poli sci,0,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,NA,2,4,3,2,4,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,6,4,3,3,2,3,NA,5,3,7,7,7,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,94,11/19/14,VE,23.4,II-SR,10,7,A,Friday,5,Yes,Leaned body against wall with clipboard,9/22/14,12/2/14,71,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,NA,1300,5000,30,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,Plastic,36.9999967,4,33,21,22,25,24,26,23,2,34,NA,NA,36,35,10,NA,9,6,7,8,5,3,30,NA,19,NA,18,20,31,27,37,29,32,0,28,14,11,13,12,NA,NA,NA,15,17,16,1,NA,11/19/14 14:05,11/19/14,14:05,11,19,14,92,111,11/19/14,11,19,14,92,111,9/22/14,9,22,14,31,53,0.816901408,0.816901408,Fail,4,4,4.5,4.5,3,NA,4,NA,3,3,4,3.25,HighPower,NA,5,NoCredentials,Male,BestGrade,0,1,1,1,1,4,+,CommunalMale,Communal,MaleTarget,NA,NA,-1,0UniversityOfToronto,50,1982,7570952,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,330,354,351,348,345,342,339,336,333,Winter 2014,B,10,1,10,3,3,5,2,6,5,3,6,2,5,"3,9,6",6,1,2,4,2,2,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,"I was amazed that I could be at such a position but at the same time, I felt the need to create better result than other people who were in similar position as I was.

I had been a starter for two and a half years but was going through a slump. The coach benched me for a game because I was not playing well at second base.

I had to approve the designs of spreads, the placement of picture, edit copy and text, manage the creation of graphics, decide who would cover events, what pictures where good pictures, who to get quotes from, what questions to ask people, the list goes on and on.

I would stay after school until 9pm, skip my lunch breaks, etc just to get it done right. They would listen to what I told them but I guess it never processed right because, no matter how many times I explained exactly what I wanted, they would never get it right. My team members would listen to me freak out (and I mean yelling and cursing-one time I even cried) and my friends in the class would empathize, but they were going through almost the same thing. The faculty adviser and the editors knew that there was a problem with my team and they tried to help but couldn't. My friends would joke that I had become a dictator and on my paper plate award they used the hash-tag, #ameliaocracy.

When I was playing I had an uneasy feeling of being judged by some unseen panel of professionals who would make a decision ultimately based off of sound alone. It was disorienting for me not to see their faces, despite the fact that on a traditional stage when the house lights go down you no longer see any faces in the audience. I didn't mess up and I felt proud- like I had proven myself to this authority- but also uneasy because I knew I was not being judged solely on my qualifications, but how I stack up against other harpists. The strangest part of the ordeal was that I knew my orchestral director was one of the people behind the curtain, so I felt obligated to be a good example for our program, but at the same time it was a whole different level of judgement coming from that authority figure, usually rehearsals are more democratic and the conductor is direct, but not judgmental about your playing.",1,8,"French, pre-med",0,3,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,1,2,2,3,2,3,1,4,4,3,3,2,14,5,5,1,1,1,2,12,5,4,4,3,2,4,72,7,3,7,7,6,1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,024C,10/17/14,MJ,NA,II-SR,10,6,A,Monday,5,Yes,,9/1/14,12/5/14,95,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,0.5,0,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,68,520,3120,500,1,0,0,1,0,1,0.09,NA,Metal,187.9999981,24,29,14,16,18,19,17,15,10,27,NA,NA,36,35,26,NA,25,7,8,9,NA,23,33,6,21,NA,20,22,34,32,37,31,30,0,28,5,2,4,3,NA,NA,11,NA,13,12,1,NA,10/17/14 13:11,10/17/14,13:11,10,17,14,61,78,10/17/14,10,17,14,61,78,9/1/14,9,1,14,31,32,0.484210526,0.484210526,Pass,7,6.5,6.5,3.5,4.5,3.2,5.5,3.333333333,5,5,4,3.75,LowPower,NA,3,NoCredentials,Female,BestGrade,1,1,0,0,1,3,+,CommunalFemale,Communal,FemaleTarget,4.2,0.150793651,-1,0UniversityOfVirginia,98,1173,7492676,18,party,NA,NA,NA,NA,I read the instructions,357,331,354,351,349,346,343,340,337,334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,5,5,6,6,1,6,5,2,3,"3,9,6,9,6,3,3,9",7,4,5,6,6,6,This Stroop task has no feedback,1,"I was a nanny for 5 kids over the summer.

As an incentive to pay attention to the lessons and participate in answering questions, I would reward correct answers to the Trivia questions with a single piece of candy the children could select from a variety in a box. My thoughts at each session were ""I really hope the kids were paying attention last week, so we don't take more than 10-15 minutes to answer seven questions..."". I was hopeful in wishing the kids to actually learn useful, important life lessons as well as enjoying the reward of candy and having fun, but at the same time, I was also used to them having no idea and simply guessing, giving general answers like, ""Jesus!"" or ""God"". I felt horrible when they gave the wrong answers, because I would have to reply, ""Nope, sorry, that's not quite it"", ""Want to try again?"" with no results. Despite feeling a little guilty when the kids were disappointed in getting the answer wrong (potential for embarrassment there, I suppose) and especially for not receiving candy, I understood that I was the teen leader and was a role model, and couldn't act ""flaky"" or ""wishy-washy"" with the kids and just give them the candy whenever they gave a off-the-mark answer. If they were rewarded every time they knowingly gave incorrect or incredibly vague answers, they would not benefit at all from the activity, and wouldn't come away from church having learned important lessons.
